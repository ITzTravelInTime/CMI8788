all code belongs to Clemens Ladisch (clemens@ladisch.de).
i'm pretty sure Clemens Ladisch is JUHMAHN for "fucking masher" ;)

also want to give credit to/acknowledge (hindu [have to say it, sry lol]) Amit Singh for his book Mac OSX Internals (http://www.osxbook.com/), which is the sole reason i am even able to attempt bridging the interupt handler to OSX (probably the most important part. and his book gives great examples)
