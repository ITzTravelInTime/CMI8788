CMI8788 ALSA driver port to APPUL (Apple) Macintosh (MAC) OSX
(Xonar HDAV/D2X/ST etc models)

still a work in progress (need to add gpio/spdif queues to IOWorkLoop and add mixer/pcm stuff)


*looks/squints through semi-spock handsign (rotated clockwise 90degrees [palms inward])*

all code belongs to Clemens Ladisch (clemens@ladisch.de).

i'm pretty sure Clemens Ladisch is JUHMAHN for "fucking masher" ;)

also want to give credit to/acknowledge Amit Singh for his book Mac OSX Internals (http://www.osxbook.com/), which is the only reason i am even able to attempt bridging the interrupt handler to OSX (probably the most important part). his book gave (at least one) great example(s).
